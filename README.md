# proteomics4AMR
## The project contains scripts for the manuscript on AMR inference from proteomics
*AMR_00_main.r is the main script that sources scripts for different components in the manuscript<br />
*AMR_01_RGI.r summarizes results for isolates from RGI (Resistance Gene Identifier)
*AMR_02_ResFinder.r summarizes results for isolates from ResFinder
*AMR_03_functions.r and AMR_04_proteomics.r process and analyze labelled MS proteomics data from MaxQuant output that searched the CARD (The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) and SwissProt databases.
